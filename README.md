Interactive mapping of brain explorer and circle connectome

1. Circular ROIs connection can show groups information at the first glance.

2. Brain explore shows the locations of connected ROIs.

Tools: XTK, D3

Data: Brain connectome extracted from brain expression data (AHBA)


An implementation of [Danny Holten](http://www.win.tue.nl/~dholten/)'s *hierarchical edge bundling* algorithm in [D3](http://d3js.org/), showing dependencies between classes in a software class hierarchy. Dependencies are bundled according to the parent packages. Thanks to [Jason Davies](http://www.jasondavies.com/) for contributing the layout implementation!
